# Rubric Folder

Every homework must have the submission rubric. The rubric is the same as generated by the Autograder. It's name, however, is of the format `hw##Rubric.json`, where the `##` is _padded_ (i.e., 0 becomes 00).

If you would also like to have a resubmission, you'll need to also add that rubric. The name of the file shall be `hw##Rubric_resub.json`, where the `##` is padded, just as before.

To remove a homework, just remove its JSON files!
